### A React + Redux + Koa Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to get you started with React and Redux. It uses Koa as for the server
but it is simple enough to switch this out to something else such as Express.

1. To get started rename the .env.template file to .env

2. make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and then execute the
following in the root of this project's directory.

```shell
   npm install
   npm start
```

3. Browse to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view the starter kit!

4. If you would like to see Redux in action make sure you have the [redux devtools chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
extension installed and pull it up in the chrome devtools pane or right click on the page and pull it up in a separate window.

This Boilerplate is a work in progress. I will be updating it whenever I learn something new and can apply it to this example app.
